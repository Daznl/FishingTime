# FishingTime
An application I made using visual studio to present data of weather to determine a good day to go fishing. The application uses BOM and WillyWeather API's to retrieve data. The application then extracts that data and processes it.

# To use
1. download and run the WeatherGUI.sln file (you will need visual studio)
2. retrieve an API key from [Willy weather](https://www.willyweather.com.au/). I can't provide mine because it is hooked up to my bank account.
3. add the Key to the WeatherDataFetcher script
4. run the application
